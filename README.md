#### Summary - This Visualization shows the total number of likes and dislikes of all channels in the dataset. It is interesting to see that SMTOWN has the highest number of likes at over 30 billion likes.
#### Design & Build - To build this, I used a bar chart showing both the likes and dislikes per channel in the dataset.

## Visualization 2 - Views Per Channel
#### Link - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathanobise/viz/ViewsPerChannel/ViewsPerChannel?publish=yes
#### Summary - With this visualization, my goal was to simply showcase the total number of views across all channels. This provides a way to see the viewership across all channels from the lowest to the highest. Marvel entertainment tops the chart with about 800 billion views followed by Dude Perfect at just above 500 billion views.
#### Design & Build - I chose a barchart because it clearly allows for easy comparison of the views across the channels.

#### Summary - This visualization shows the growth in terms of comments made by users over the years. It is also worth noting that the increase in the number of channels in more recent years also led to the increase in the number of comments.
#### Design & Build - I chose a line chart as it provides a way to see the growth trend of comments over the years for Youtube channels in the US.
#### Resources - N/A
